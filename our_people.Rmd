I'm a statistician with 10 years of experience as a statistician in the academia and the pharmaceutical industry where he specializes in applying optimal statistical design & strategy, including Bayesian
approaches and adaptive design strategies.

Early in my career, while under a PhD program, I have provided statistical consulting services at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, helping researchers in applying appropriate statistical methodologies and also providing statistical trainings for statisticians and non-statisticians.

In 2014, I joined the food industry where I have contributed, in a fully in-house model, to the clinical development and operations in the area of preterm and neonate nutrition products.
In 2016, I moved to the pharmaceutical industry where I had the chance to serve as lead statistician in support of phase I-III drug development in multiple therapeutic areas (haemato-oncology, oncology and infection) and novel therapeutic products (CAR T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapeutics, antibody drug conjugates, ...).

Jonathan provides a rigorous scientific approach to problem solving together with a client-oriented perspective enabling him to maneuver seamlessly between statistical considerations, clinical development needs and operational challenges.
