Thanks to the R community, R-based solutions are ready to be used to support end-to-end clinical reporting.

The following services are proposed for the implementation of R-based solutions for clinical reporting:

- Project management for the implementation of R-based solution for clinical reporting
- Support in setting up R framework for SDTM and ADaM datasets (specification, programming and reviewer's guide)
- Creation of analysis data results
- Outputing of analysis data results in pdf, rtf, docx, html
- R tools to support submission of eCTD
- Creation and maintenance of tools for metadata management
- Utility function for log export and R environment setup
