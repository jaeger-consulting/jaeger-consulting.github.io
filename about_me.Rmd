I'm a statistician with 10 years of experience in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. I specialized myself in applying Bayesian and adaptive statistical designs & strategies.

Early in my career, while under a PhD program, I developed a Bayesian penalized smoothing approach for solving differential equations with application to pharmacokinetic and recovery studies [see @Jaeger2013; @Jaeger2014; @Frasso2016; @Frasso2016a]. In addition, during this period, I have provided statistical consulting services at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, helping researchers in applying appropriate statistical methodologies. I had also the opportunity to give statistical trainings for statisticians and non-statisticians.

I joined the food industry in 2014 where I have contributed, in a fully in-house model, to the clinical development and operations in the area of preterm nutrition [@Rigo2017] and other nutrition solutions [@Binia2015].

In 2016, I moved to the pharmaceutical industry where I was lead statistician in support of phase I-III drug development in multiple therapeutic areas (haemato-oncology, oncology and infection) and novel therapeutic products (CAR T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapeutics, antibody drug conjugates, ...). Given the high unmet medical need context and novel therapy setting, rigorous and agile statistical expertise was essential to maneuver seamlessly the clinical project between clinical development needs, regulatory requirements and operational challenges.

I have created Jaeger Consulting in 2020 with the goal to nurture early and late clinical development with statistical innovation. Bayesian approaches, adaptive design strategies and informed quantitative decision-making tools are basis elements promoted for fastering clinical development.
