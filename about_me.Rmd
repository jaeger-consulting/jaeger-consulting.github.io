I'm a statistician with 10 years of experience in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. I specialized myself in applying Bayesian and adaptive statistical designs & strategies.

Early in my career, while under a PhD program, I developed a Bayesian penalized smoothing approach for solving differential equations with application to pharmacokinetic and recovery studies [see @Jaeger2013; @Jaeger2014; @Frasso2016; @Frasso2016a]. In addition, during this period, I have provided statistical consulting services at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, helping researchers in applying appropriate statistical methodologies. I had also the opportunity to give statistical trainings for statisticians and non-statisticians.

In 2014, I joined the food industry where I have contributed, in a fully in-house model, to the clinical development and operations in the area of preterm nutrition [@Rigo2017] and other nutrition solutions [@Binia2015].

In 2016, I moved to the pharmaceutical industry where I had the chance to serve as lead statistician in support of phase I-III drug development in multiple therapeutic areas (haemato-oncology, oncology and infection) and novel therapeutic products (CAR T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapeutics, antibody drug conjugates, ...).

Jonathan provides a rigorous scientific approach to problem solving together with a client-oriented perspective enabling him to maneuver seamlessly between statistical considerations, clinical development needs and operational challenges.
